<div class="component-title">ng-container</div>
<div class="content-container">
  The Angular ng-container is a grouping element that doesn't interfere with styles or layout because Angular doesn't put it in the DOM.

  <p>
    I turned the corner
    <ng-container *ngIf="hero">
      and saw {{hero.name}}. I waved
    </ng-container>
    and continued on my way.
